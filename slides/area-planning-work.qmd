# About

# Package development

## What packages am I using?

My data analysis and mapping work depends on a tall stack of open-source packages especially from the `{tidyverse}` along with the [rOpenSci]() and rspatial communities. 

I have a lot of favorite R packages across a few different categories:

- development
- programming
- visualization
- data management

### Packages I use for development

- `{usethis}`
- `{devtools}`
- `{sinew}`
- `{testthat}`
- `{pkgdown}`

### Packages I use for programming

- `{sf}`
- `{dplyr}` (and `{vctrs}`)
- `{rlang}`
- `{cli}`
- `{httr2}`

### Packages I use for visualization

- [mapboxapi](https://walker-data.com/mapboxapi/)
- `{ggplot2}` (with Adobe Illustrator sometimes)
- `{mapview}`
- [feltr](https://elipousson.github.io/feltr/)* (with Felt)
- `{gt}`

### Packages I use for data management

- `{osmdata}` (with OpenStreetMap)
- `{rairtable}` [development version](https://github.com/matthewjrogers/rairtable/tree/dev)* (with Airtable)
- `{googlesheets4}` (with Google Sheets)
- `{officer}` (with Microsoft Word)

## When did I start building packages?

- June 2019: Started learning R
- Oct. 2020: Started `{mapbaltimore}` after a webinar on working with the `{mapboxapi}` package
- Dec. 2020: Started contributing to open-source packages, `{FlickrAPI}`, `{esri2sf}`, and `{mapboxapi}`
- November 2021: `{crashapi}` for accessing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) API

## What types of packages am I working on?

- local data packages
- data access packages
- analysis and visualization packages

## How did I get to this current approach?

Data packages -> Utility packages -> Visualization packages

::: notes

Initially:

- 2021?: Split `{overedge}` from `{mapbaltimore}`
- Split:
- June 2022: Split `{overedge}` into a few smaller packages: `{sfext}`, `{getdata}`, and `{maplayer}`
- `{streetmixr}` for working with the Street Mix API
- January 2023: `{officerExtras}` for extending the `{officer}` package (and working with tables and heading in Microsoft Word)
- May 2023: `{feltr}` for working with the Felt API (Felt is a new, highly recommend online mapping application)

More recently:

- July 2023: `{getACS}` for downloading `{tidycensus}` data, adding supplementary metadata, and making plots and tables
- September 2023: `{sharepointr}` for reading and writing files and lists from SharePoint

## What are some local data projects am I working on?

A few packages:

- `{bcpss}`: Tidy survey, program, and zone data from and about Baltimore City Public Schools. 
- `{marylandedu}`: Tidy enrollment and demographic data from Maryland State Department of Education.
- `{baltimorecensus}`: Accessible U.S. Census geographies.
- `{baltimoremls}`: Utility functions for Bright MLS sales data.

## What are some local data projects am I working on?

A few data analyses (all WIP):

- bcpsstransportation*
- baltimorecrash*
- [baltimoretaxsale](https://github.com/elipousson/baltimoretaxsale)

## What am I hoping to try next?

- `{targets}`
- `{rdeck}`
- `{arcgislayers}`

# Applications of R in Planning

![John Ruhrah EMS INSPIRE Plan](images/2023-06-08_john-ruhrah-ems_inspire-plan_cover.jpg)

## All the little things

- Maps
- Tables
- Graphics
- Writing

## Making the little things takes a lot of work

- Data import and tidying
- Data transformation and analysis
- Managing text
- Managing multiple output formats

## Example: Tables with demographic data using `{getACS}`

- What do you do in advance?
- What do you do as needed?

## Setup

```{r}
# pak::pkg_install("elipousson/getACS")
library(getACS)
library(tidyverse)
```

## First steps

- Get data
- Combine with metadata
- Recalculate variables
- Use areal interpolation as needed

---

Using getACS to get data, combine with metadata, and recalculate estimates as a share of the denominator:

```{r}
delmarva_acs <- map(
  c("MD", "DC", "VA"),
  ~ get_acs_geographies(
  geography = c("county", "state"),
  table = "B08134",
  state = .x,
  quiet = TRUE
  )
)

dc_acs <- delmarva_acs[[2]]

dc_acs
```

## Next steps

- Subset data to area
- Recode values if needed
- Create table or visualization

```{r}
commute_acs_tbl <- dc_acs |> 
  filter_acs(
    indent == 1,
    line_number >= 11,
    geography = "state"
    ) |> 
  select_acs(.name_col = NULL) |> 
  gt_acs(
    column_title_label = "Mode of transportation",
    table = dc_acs$table_id
  )
```

```{r}
commute_acs_tbl
```
